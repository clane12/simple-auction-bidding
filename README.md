💰 Bidding System (Python CLI)
A simple Bidding System implemented in Python. This game simulates a bidding process where multiple participants can place their bids, and the highest bidder wins. The program ensures no two participants share the same name by appending a random number to their names.

✨ Features
📝 Collects participant names and bids

💡 Ensures unique participant identification by appending a random number

🏆 Determines the highest bid and announces the winner

❌ Continues accepting bids until the user decides to stop

🎨 Displays an ASCII logo (for visual appeal)

📦 Requirements
Python 3.x+

No external dependencies (uses built-in Python libraries)

🚀 How to Run
Save the script as bidding_system.py.

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

Run the game by typing the following command in your terminal:
python bidding_system.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to place bids. The program will continue accepting bids until no more participants want to join.

🧠 Sample Gameplay
Welcome to the Bidding System
***********************

bidding starts: -------------
What is your Name?: John
How much would you like to bid?: 100
Are there others who would like to bid, say 'yes' or 'no' no

{'John65': 100}
The highest bid is 100 from John65!
🧩 Logic Overview
The program starts by displaying an ASCII logo and prompts users to enter their names and bids.

It stores each participant’s bid in a dictionary, ensuring no duplicate names by appending a random number to each name.

Once all bids are collected, the program identifies the highest bid and declares the winner.

🔮 Future Enhancements
💰 Implement a price threshold or minimum bid to make the game more interesting.

🧮 Add a budget system, allowing users to place multiple bids.

📈 Display a leaderboard or ranking of bids.

🎮 Create a graphical interface (GUI) using tkinter or pygame for better interaction.
